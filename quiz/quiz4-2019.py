"""This quiz is a simplified version of 2020 presidential election. Write a definition for a class named Candidate
with the following methods:

1, An __init__ method that initializes name, winning_states and number of votes.
2, A __str__ method that returns a string representation of this candidate, including name and winning state(s).
3, A method named win_state that takes a string of state abbreviation, adds it to winning_states and update votes.
4, A special method that overloads the operator '>' to compare votes of two candidates.

DO NOT change code in main method!

--------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------
The expected outputs should be like below :


Donald Trump has not won any state yet.
Elizabeth Warren has won MA.

After election:
Donald Trump has won FL, TX.
Elizabeth Warren has won MA, CA.

Does Trump win?
True
